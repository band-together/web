### Git etiquette

1. Fork the repo to your personal GitHub account
2. Code on a branch named related to the feature or task you're working on
3. Open a PR from your branch to the ```dev``` branch of the master repository

### Set up

1. Install yarn: ```brew install yarn``` on Mac, install Homebrew if you don't have this command
2. From the root directory, ```yarn install``` to pull down the dependencies
3. Open the project in your favorite IDE, and run ```yarn start``` to start the dev server
4. Start coding!
